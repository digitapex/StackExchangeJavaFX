# Stack Exchange JavaFx Application

This application collects questions from the homepages of all the different Stack Exchange sites.

The sites to follow can be chosen.

The buttons open the corresponding question links in the default browser.

You can get the jar under [releases](https://github.com/digitapex/StackExchangeJavaFX/releases).
Run it in the Windows Command Prompt or in the Linux Terminal by executing:
```
java -jar Stack.jar
```
The application creates configuration files *followedSites.txt* and *settings.properties* in the same folder where the *Stack.jar* is located.
